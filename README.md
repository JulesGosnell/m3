# m3

This is the m3 project.

It is based upon a validator for a subset of JSON which I wrote for Agora Digital Capital Markets (https://agoradcm.com/), and which they have kindly donated to the project - my thanks to them for allowing me to share this code.

I aspire to it becoming a complete and fully featured JSON validator which can be run and produce identical results in both the backend and frontend of any Clojure[Script] application.

It is tested (lein test) against https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite. There are still holes in fn-ality - I hope to plug these soon.

I'm planning to get a feature table up soon to show you how complete this validator is and some jars out onto clojars soon.

If you find this useful or interesting and would like to get involved, please give me a shout.
