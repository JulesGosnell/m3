# m3

[![CI](https://github.com/JulesGosnell/m3/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JulesGosnell/m3/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is the m3 project - a pure Clojure JSON validator.

It is based upon a validator for a subset of JSON which I wrote for [Agora Digital Capital Markets](https://agoradcm.com/), and which they have kindly donated to the project - my thanks to them for allowing me to share this code.

I aspire to it becoming a complete and fully featured JSON validator which can be run and produce identical results in both the backend and frontend of any Clojure[Script] application.

It is tested (lein test) against [JSON-Schema-Test-Suite](https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite). There are still holes in fn-ality - I hope to plug these soon.

Here is a table of M3's current [features](https://julesgosnell.github.io/m3/features.html) - it needs updating but it will give you an idea of how much is implemented.

I hope to get a release up to Clojars soon.

If you find this useful or interesting and would like to get involved, please give me a shout.


Jules
