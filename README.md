# m3

This is the m3 project.

It is based upon a validator for a subset of JSON which I did for Agora Digital Capital Markets (https://agoradcm.com/), and which they have kindly donated to the project

I aspire to it becoming a complete and fully featured JSON validator which can be run and produce identical results in both the backend and frontend of any Clojure[Script] application.

It is tested (lein test) against https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite
